        <b>💨🍃 [windy]</b><br>
        <br>
        windy<br>
        I'm autumn leaves when she's around<br>
        she spreads my trash to other people in town<br>
        she chaps my lips so red<br>
        she fills my stuffy head<br>
        <br>
        passing through my empty spaces<br>
        blowing hair in other faces I could love<br>
        <br>
        stayed indoors<br>
        thought you wouldn't find me<br>
        then I felt you coming in through the window of  my bedroom<br>
        stayed indoors, hoping it would remind me<br>
        that, just like you, I can't change the wind<br>
        <br>
        she shakes the shutters on my windows<br>
        she tears up the trees I took so long to grow<br>
        <br>
        // no doubt - sunday morning<br>
        <br>
        you came in with the breeze on a sunday morning<br>
        you sure have changed since yesterday<br>
        without any warning<br>
        I thought I knew you so well<br>
