        <br>
        I am the young day smith<br>
        wheelie day after day<br>
        past the no-names you play with<br>
        whip 10-speed, I leave plebs with a lisp<br>
        I've got change if your chain<br>
        is in need of replacement<br>
        <br>
        streaks in your jeans<br>
        I leave streaks in the pavement<br>
        conversation as obscene<br>
        as my savings account statements<br>
        (thanks mom)<br>
        I get ape shit, I stay up late<br>
        roaming the o with my spokes on rotate<br>
        <br>
        only 2 wheels, but my whip is really mine<br>
        only 2 wheels, but I get around fine<br>
        everytime, I handle bars as easy as riding a bike<br>
        and I can ride my bike with no handlebars<br>
        <br>
        you can't fuck with me<br>
        when I'm riding on my bicycle<br>
        looking fly as fuck on my mongoose<br>
        I've got my helmet on loose, sipping on juice<br>
        you already know I run the neighborhood<br>
