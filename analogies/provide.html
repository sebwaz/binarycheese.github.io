        <b>ｖｏｉｄ  ｍｅ（ｙｏｕ）</b><br>
        <br>
        I’d build you a house<br>
        but there isn’t much these arms can lift<br>
        <br>
        I’d buy you a datsun<br>
        but there isn’t much this wallet fits<br>
        <br>
        I’ll fly you away from here<br>
        just let me save to buy the tickets<br>
        <br>
        I’ll lie with you when<br>
        my body is all I have to give<br>
        <br>
        you have my shoulder and my ear<br>
        I’ll gather pretty words for you to hear<br>
        there’s nothing else I can provide for you<br>
