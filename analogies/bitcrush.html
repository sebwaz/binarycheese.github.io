        <br>
        the way that she walks<br>
        is like leaves on the breeze<br>
        my skin is hit with sunbeams when she looks at me<br>
        I can hear her smile when she talks<br>
        and we can talk about nothing<br>
        nothing at all just to hear her speak<br>
        <br>
        her beauty is something that my eyes can't see<br>
        my eyes can see her prettiness,<br>
        but what affects the rest of me?<br>
        don't overthink it<br>
        someday I may know<br>
        but the probability goes to zero<br>
        as time approaches infinity<br>
        <br>
        do you see me the way I see you?<br>
        can you hear me?<br>
        am I coming through?<br>
        <br>
        bitcrush<br>
        how I'd like to see your details<br>
        and if only I could reach you<br>
        I would see you clearly now<br>
        <br>
        I'm not too good with words<br>
        but she's like the lyrics to every song<br>
        about a girl I've ever heard<br>
        she makes my knees weak<br>
        so badly, I literally couldn't stand it<br>
        if I were to see her holding hands with another<br>
        <br>
        it is strange that the stranger made me feel like this<br>
        a kind of sickness<br>
        that shit is visceral<br>
        she's so hip to her literal hips<br>
        the kind of bits undescribed in single syllables<br>
